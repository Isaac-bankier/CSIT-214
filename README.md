This is the github for "team next to the door" for csit214. The assignment specification says we need to use git (or something similar) to keep track of changes and to keep accurate logs of our work. The folder "implementation" will hold the code so don't add anything to that unless you're working on that. Likewise for the "minutes" folder.

And finally **Please add meaningfull commit messages!!!**

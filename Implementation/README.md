To run the prototype do the following:

1. Install GHC and Cabal via the instructions here https://www.haskell.org/downloads/
2. Change directory into the implementation folder and run `cabal repl`
3. Wait for the dependencies to finish downloading then run `:main`
4. A message will be displayed with a link to were the site is running (this is probably 127.0.0.1:8000)
5. To test you can use the test customers alice@example.com, bob@example.com, or the test employee eric@example.com. The password for all of these is `pass`. Alternatively you could m=register a new customer.
